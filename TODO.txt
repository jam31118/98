- How about forking recursively? How do those children processes behave?
- let's 'shm_unlink'
- check all the error return values!
- utilize both stdout and stderr

- shared memory should be in #define so that it can be accessed by any code segments
- the shm should be opened in each processes!
- all shm and sem should be opened and also closed in each processes!

- why do we ftruncate()?
