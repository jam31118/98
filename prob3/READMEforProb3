PROBLEM 03

## Shared Variable Description

The declarations of shared variables can be found 
in the source file "prob3/problem3.c" as the following:

==============================
typedef struct sh_data {
	int buffer[BUFSIZE];
	int SUM;
	int *write_ptr, *read_ptr;
	int write_idx, read_idx;
	int m, n;
	int consumer_end_flag;
} sh_data_t;
==============================

where 
- 'buffer' is and buffer array with length 20
- 'SUM' is summation result generated by consumers processes
- 'write_ptr' is a pointer for an element in buffer into which 
  the current producer in its critical section put what it'd produced
- 'read_ptr' is a pointer for an element in buffer from which 
  the current consumer in its critical section 
  read the produced datum and put zero instead
- 'write_idx' is an integer for counting 
  how many data had been put into buffer by producers
- 'read_idx' is an interger for counting 
  how many data had been read out from buffer by consumers
- 'm' and 'n' are the number of producers and consumers, respectively
- 'consumer_end_flag' is an integer(or boolean, precisely) indicating 
  if all the conditions that should be met for terminating all consumers


## Execution Result Samples
NOTE: The result given below is just the value of shared variable 'SUM'. 
The full output including some instructive messages are given as separate file 
'problem3.result.m2n7.log' in a 'prob3' directory under tar arhive root.

(a) m = 1, n = 1
 $ ./problem3 1 1
 1275

(b) m = 1, n = 2
 $ ./problem3 1 2
 1275

(c) m = 2, n = 1
 $ ./problem3 2 1
 2550

(d) m = 2, n = 2
 $ ./problem3 2 2
 2550

(e) m = 5, n = 7
 $ ./problem3 5 7
 6375

(f) m = 100, n = 1000
 $ ./problem3 100 1000
 127500

(g) m = 1, n = 1000
 $ ./problem3 1 1000
 1275

(h) m = 1, n = 10000
 $ ./problem3 1 10000
 1275
